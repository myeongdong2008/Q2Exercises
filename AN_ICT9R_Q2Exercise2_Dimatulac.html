      No point in <span style= "color: #006400; font-family: Bebas Neue">turning off the lights</span><br>
      Not the same without your head on my shoulders<br>
      Growing pains, but I don't wanna get older<br>

    <center><p style="font-family: Cheva Display;">Couple feelings that were laid to rest<br>
       Didn't know that the party was over<br>
       And it's true that I need you, get closer</center>

    <center><p>Burning photos, had to learn to let go, whoa
       I used to weep<br>
       Somebody in another skin (another skin)<br>
       I heard that you're happy without me<br>
       And I hope it's true (I hope, I hope it's true)<br>
       It kills me a little, that's okay<br>
       'Cause I'd die for you<br>
       You know I'd still <span style= "color: #006400; font-family: Bebas Neue">die for you</span></p></center>

   <center><p><p style="font-family: Cheva Display;">I hope you're getting everything you needed<br>
      Find the puzzle piece and feel completed<br>
      Just wanted you to know every reason<br>
      Hope you really know that I mean that<br>
      Couldn't see the forest from the trees<br>
      The only time we speak is in my dreams</p></center>
